easy/medium/hard:
- countdown conundrum (only root word, 30 second time limit)
- against the clock (all words, variable time limit)  
- to completion (all words)

clare's suggestions
- change font of orange tiles to something bigger and bolder 
- at end of game, screen goes back to menu too quickly.  leave words on screen until user clicks something to go back to menu
- highlight whether the word is right or wrong better.  make box bigger and maybe colour word in red or green so that it can be seen in corner of eye
- why isn't bap in dictionary?
- give user a score like what percentage of words they found
